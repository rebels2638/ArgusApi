      <strong>How did you get here?!</strong>
      <br/>
      This page is reserved for Argus's communication with the outside world. So... I don't think it will be as helpful for a human reader :)<br/>
      It is NOT a REST API, thus all of the data here are statically hosted and changed via GitHub, and deployed to GitHub pages!
      <br/>
